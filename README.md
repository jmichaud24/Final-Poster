# Final-Poster
For a graduate data analysis course, I was tasked with answering an empirical question using data and statistical analysis and displaying the results in a poster format.

Using data from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs' 2022 Survey of Public Opinion on US Foreign Policy (https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/2022-chicago-council-survey), I wanted to test the relationship between political ideology and respondents' feelings towards Germany. 

The dataset included respondent ratings of their feelings towards Germany on a scale of 0 to 100 (with a higher number meaning a more positive feeling) and ratings of their own political ideology from 1 (Extremely Liberal) to 7 (Extremely Conservative). I hypothesized that more conservative ideology ratings would be negative associated with feelings towards Germany.

I conducted a regression analysis testing the effect of political ideology on feelings towards Germany, controlling for political party identification, support for NATO, Christian identification, and whether respondents voted for Trump in 2020.

I found that ideology had a statistically significant, negative effect on feelings towards Germany. A one-point increase in ideology score (meaning a shift to the right) resulted in an average 2.4 point decrease in feelings for Germany, controlling for other variables.

# Final-Poster
For a graduate data analysis course, I was tasked with answering an empirical question using data and statistical analysis and displaying the results in a poster format.

Using data from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs' 2022 Survey of Public Opinion on US Foreign Policy, I wanted to test the relationship between political ideology and respondents' feelings towards Germany. The dataset included respondent ratings of their feelings towards Germany on a scale of 0 to 100 (with a higher number meaning a more positive feeling) and ratings of their own political ideology from 1 (Extremely Liberal) to 7 (Extremely Conservative). I hypothesized that more conservative ideology ratings would be negative associated with feelings towards Germany.

I conducted a regression analysis testing the effect of political ideology on feelings towards Germany. I controlled for a Trump vote in 2020, supported for the US commitment to NATO, political party identification, and identification as a Christian.

I found that ideology had a statistically significant, negative effect with feelings towards Germany. A one-point increase in ideology score (meaning a shift to the right) resulted on average in a 2.4 point decrease in feelings for Germany, controlling for other variables.
